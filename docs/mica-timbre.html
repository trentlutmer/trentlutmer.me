                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Think back to the last time you bought a CD, a cassette, or vinyl. For me, it was in 2005 and I saved enough money to get 50 Cent’s The Massacre on CD. I drove to Sam Goody’s, dropped a $20 bill on the counter, and blared Outta Control the whole ride home.
                </br></br>With widespread access to music, it’s easier now than ever to find and play your favorite song all on your phone. For some it’s synonymous with their lives. It’s how they wake up, focus at work, and fall asleep.
                </br></br>For artists, they rely on those purchases. With concerts, tours, shows postponed, more artists are finding other sources of income. Concerts gave listeners the opportunity to support their favorite musicians. For musicians and artists, the money they make touring goes to their music.

                <h2>Scope and Constraints</h2>
                <p>This project took place between July and August 2021. As part of my graduate program, my assignment was to design an end-to-end experience and apply our knowledge from the past 15 months. Throughout this capstone project, I researched, mapped workflows, built prototypes, and tested solutions with users. At the end give a 15 minute presentation and write a case study for my portfolio.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-half">
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Research was by far the most difficult part. I spent a while creating and sending a screener only to find seven participants. In my initial research, Listeners felt uncertain about acceptable digital wallets and how much to donate. They sat at the Venmo payment screen trying to figure the right amount. Listeners looked to donate after they heard about Spotify’s annual payouts to artists. Now they are looking for ways to reconcile their guilt from the endless amounts of music they played.
                </br></br>Musicians didn’t like transferring money and were unsure of how much money they made. Spotify makes them download a separate app to see their work. Musicians turned to Spotify as it’s the most popular streaming app but managing money and music is hard.
                </br></br>“I go to small local events all the time. I always see their Venmo accounts but I get to the payment screen and stop. How much do I donate? How much were CDs back in the day?! I don’t remember.”
                </br></br>“I don’t want to be my own CFO. I just graduated from school and am trying to make it in the music business. Marketing is hard enough, but throwing the money on top makes it impossible to manage it all.”

            <div class="grid-half">
                <h2>The Audience</h2>
                <p>Continuing my research, I synthesized my findings into an Affinity Map. To further explore my users and their goals, I completed a Jobs-to-be-done activity. This helped me determine my design goals as well.   
                </br></br>Once done, I created some personas + empathy maps. This way I could feel a bit closer to them and understand the ‘Whys’ before I began creating solutions. Empathy is one of the hardest to uncover, so I pushed myself to make sure I ‘got it’.</p>

            <img class="grid-full" src="images/timbre/004_Timbre.jpg">
            <div class="grid-half">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Once I felt like I knew my users, I looked at my own goals for this project.
                </br></br>✶ Design a music app that embraces and rewards creativity
                </br></br>✶ Encourage listeners to give back
                </br></br>✶ Sprinkle in cryptocurrency
                </br></br>✶ Finish before Aug 20
                </br></br>Moving forward, I created a quick Sprint map to showcase a new workflow and the areas of opportunity. My focus became donating money for listeners and transferring money to their bank account. There were another 10 features I looked at but for time sake, I decided to focus on these two experiences.
                </br></br>And from those high-level goals, I wanted to measure them and hold me accountable for my solutions.

                </br></br>My plan was to do some Crazy 8 sketches, but decided to pivot to normal sketches. Crazy 8’s and dot voting are more collaborative exercises and since this was solo, I just came up with various ideas.

                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>I explored a couple solutions but landed on these two wireframed experiences. Besides a quick conversation with my Listener Friend, I didn’t have time for testing. (Yes I know that's not a good thing, but that’s also a real-work life situation so I had to roll with it.)
                </br></br>Once I found a good experience I began exploring the personality of the app. I spent a bit of time figuring out the mood of the app. I wanted this Vaporware/Cyberpunk vibe. Inspiration from the Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars became the foundation of the visual design and the UI Kit. I put it all together and built a prototype using Figma.

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <p>Here is Timbre. It’s a music streaming platform that looks to give back to our favorite artists. We’ll look to start a music rebellion and sway the power back those musicians we love. I like to think of it as a combination of SoundCloud, Patreon, and Venmo.
                </br></br>Listeners can freely donate to a musician, add any payment method including Bitcoin, and find local concerts in their area. In the future, I’ll add my own payment system, AI and ML for new music discovery, and more tour information.
                </br></br>Musicians can see the money they’ve made over time, statistics about their music, transfer their earnings without a fee, and set up scheduled auto-transfers. Next I’ll add iteration , I’ll add a music upload system, more marketing/social media solutions, and integrate with finance apps like Acorns and Mint.

                <h2>Test</h2>
                <p>Happy with my experiences, I conducted four usability tests between August 11-14th, 2021. Each session lasted approximately 30-45 minutes. I took my solution to testing. With 2 listener and 2 musician tests over three days. I wanted to focus on task completion for these tests.
                </br></br>✶ 100% of listeners could donate to a musician in less than 15 sec
                </br></br>✶ 50% of listeners could change payment methods in less than 10 seconds
                </br></br>✶ 50% of musicians could transfer their balance in less than 10 seconds
                </br></br>✶ 100% of musicians could set up an auto-transfer in less than 90 seconds       
                </p>

            <div class="grid-half">
                <h2>Next steps</h2>
                <p>Looking back at my success metrics, my usability tests were 75% successful. One listener couldn’t change their payment in under 10 seconds. And one musician couldn’t transfer their balance in less than 10 seconds. Still successful but still room for improvement.
                </br></br>“Donating is easy; I wouldn't donate more than $20 at once, especially for several artists.”
                </br></br>The biggest concerns:
                </br></br>✶ More discovery research and usability tests
                </br></br>✶ Emphasize the selected payment method
                </br></br>✶ Add more money statistics for musicians
                </br></br>✶ Integrate more blockchain ideas
                </br></br>✶ Create in-house payment system
                </br></br>✶ Play with other colors and opacity
                </p>

            <div class="grid-half">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To summarize everything, I spent the last two months working on a music platform that gives back to the artists. I designed an end-to-end experience backed by research to make design driven decisions that helped me bring my idea to life .And although it wasn’t perfect, I learned a lot and will work to be better.
                </br></br>Streaming services are flippin’ awesome. I love Spotify. It knows me so well and have formed a great relationship with them after Rdio. I hate that I trust them. But next time you pull up those free lofi beats on YouTube, think… How do the artists make money?
