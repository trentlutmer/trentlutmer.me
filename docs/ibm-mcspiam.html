                <p>The Multi-cloud SaaS Platform (MCSP) aims to unify its administrative features. Users can manage accounts, subscriptions, billing, identity, access, and single sign-on through MCSP.</p>
                <p>As the product designer, I had to research and define IAM features for MCSP. I worked with designers, product managers, developers, architects, and content designers across six time zones.</p>

                <p>Today System and IT administrators use 8+ systems to buy and manage their IBM SaaS subscriptions. Managing clear IAM boundaries in a CLI is manual. It leads to redundancy, errors, and excessive approvals.</p>
                <p>Simply put, who is this person? Are they allowed here? What are they allowed to do? Let’s ensure the right people have the right things for the right reasons. </p>

                <p>The task was to create an experience for IT and System admins. It must let them identify, authenticate, and authorize any resource or entity, securely and efficiently, on a single platform. This included a focus on enhancing the onboarding experience and increasing adoption rates.</p>

                <p>There are three parts to granting secure access to an organization’s resources, identity, authorization, and authentication. For us, the first phase only included identity and authorization.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✶ Identity management – A user list with the ability to add, edit, view, and remove users.</li>
                    <li>✶ Authorization (Access) management – Role-based Access Controls (RBAC) so they can manage their scope (an account, subscription, or instance) and entities (a user, user group, and service ID).</li>

                    <li>✶ I worked with designers, product managers, developers, architects, and content designers across six time zones.</li>
                    <li>✶ The framework saves development time by 60%.</li>
                    <li>✶ Go-to-market deliverables increase speed by five times.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our next challenge lay in providing seamless and controlled access to this workforce. This includes Single Sign-On (SSO), Federated Identity, (IdP configuration), and Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning.</p>
