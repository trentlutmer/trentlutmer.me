                        <p>IBM Partner Engagement Manager, formally known as Multi-enterprise Relationship Manager, is a service that tracks relationships among users. We provide tools to create campaigns and monitors the status of various campaigns across your organization.</p>

                            <p>We redesigned two components — the dashboard and activity designer experiences.</p>
                            <p>The dashboard was designed to introduce clarity around users current campaigns, tasks, and trading partners. Previously, the dashboard was a page with text about the product and provided no purpose for our users. Instead, our idea was to help users restart from their previous task in hopes they would finish.</p>
                            <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/MRM_Research.jpg">
                            <p>Throughout the ideation, we met with users and tested each piece of the prototype, from the data visualizations to the types of campaigns they wished to see. The reaction from users was positive, but the negative feedback revolved around the campaigns themselves and them both feeling more cohesive.</p>

                        <h3>Solutions —</h3>
                        <p>Throughout Emptoris’ 15-year history, the interface and experience never changed and has underwent several acquisitions that only dampered it’s already fragile state. Knowing that, we began anew.</p>

                        </div>      
                        <p>As we began the redesign of Contract Management, we held monthly meetings to review the beta with customers, and receive constructive feedback. From the customer research, we established that the largest pain points in Contract Management were:</p>
                        <p>We examined how we can make managing contracts more collaborative.</p>

                        <p>The activity designer was built to create any type of campaign or process. In previous iterations, users had to create an activity by dragging flowchart pieces and linking them together. On average, it took our users 21 days to create and became too difficult for activities with 100s of steps. We provided a template system that helped streamline the creation and assign team members to the campaign.</p>

                        <h3>Impact —</h3>
                        <p>To validate our designs, we set up usability tests to evaluate the visibility across all campaigns and the creation of an campaign. We asked our users to find complete a campaign that was assigned to them, and create a new one.</p>
                        <p>Over the next couple weeks, the results were ‘somewhat positive’. The average completion rate was at 64%, adoption was at 51%, retention grew by 32%. Users were able to understand the status and campaign completion but they still had troubles creating campaigns because they needed several basic features to create campaigns — like rich text formatting and branching.</p>
