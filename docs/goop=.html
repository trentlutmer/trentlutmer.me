                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>In June of 2014, I spent 18 months as a UX designer on Emptoris Contract Management (ECM). My role on the team was to rethink the experience and visual design for the search, dashboard, and contract editor. The team’s goal was to fit Emptoris with a new user experience while maintaining the current list features that our customers currently love.</p>
                    <p>ECM is a product that manages the lifecycle of contracts among users through continuous communication. Users are able to create and track contracts through its different stages and easily send notifications to alert users.</p>
