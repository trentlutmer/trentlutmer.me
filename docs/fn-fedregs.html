                <p>FiscalNote manages your political strategy to influence and impact legislators. I reformed workflows for regulators to surface comments and feel more effective.</p>
                <p>As the lead designer, my role was to research and define the new experience. My team consisted of a product manager, front-end developer, data scientist, and an intern researcher.</p>

                <h2><span class="subhead">Discovery</span></br>Research</h2>
                <p>Our target audience revolved around regulatory affairs managers. The motive is to stay proactive on matters and protect the company. The government will issue million-dollar fines if not done well. We found users find and save documents with bookmarks, then download and print it. They read it when traveling.</p>
            </div>

                <h2><span class="subhead">Define</span></br>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The main problem was easing the fear of missing out on policy information to lessen fines. Staying on top of any issue, and being proactive is key to building their strategy. To ensure the success of the product, I created metrics that the team would follow.</p>
                <ul>      
                    <li>✶ We will be successful if we reduce the time to identify similar comments by 50% within six months.</li>
                    <li>✶ We will be successful if we deliver a clear and cohesive experience on our platforms.</li>

                <h2><span class="subhead">Delivery</span></br>Solution</h2>
                <p>We redesigned two components — the comment themes and document viewer experiences.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✶ Comment Themes are groupings of public comments based on the language in the text. Comments sorted and searchable by text help lobbyists build coalitions and networks. </li>
                    <li>✶ The document viewer displays documents and comments within the platform—the viewer displays and searches for language to share information with their managers. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2><span class="subhead">Outcome</span></br>Impact</h2>
                <p>To prove our assumptions, we measured the comment themes, document viewer, and ease of use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✶ Find like-minded comments - 1:38 from 3 minutes. It was not a 50% decrease but close.</li>
                    <li>✶ Viewing documents: 100% found it useful, but had suggestions for improvement.</li>
                    <li>✶ Ease of Use: 79% found it more useful than previous but not the 90% goal. Browser bookmarks are a one and done solution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall positive, but we prioritized several improvements. The visual design was an on-going issue. Highlighting and commenting were the most important so users can build their own comments. Continuing to ingest more global data. Over the next month, the new offering added $1.8 million to the company's ARR. </p>
