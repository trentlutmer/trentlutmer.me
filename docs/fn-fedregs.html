                        <p>In 2013, I spent a year and a half as the design lead on Partner Engagement Manager or PEM.  This was my first incursion as a design lead and worked closely with the engineering and product management teams. The team’s goal was to design a new product that would nurture partner relationships and build trust.</p>
                        <p>PEM, formally known as Multi-enterprise Relationship Manager, is an application that manages the relationship among users through on-going partner engagement. Users are able to create and monitor the lifecycle of various different process and easily surface supplier information.</p>

                    <div> 
                        <div class="label">The Problem</div>
                        <p>Throughout Emptoris’ 15-year history, the interface and experience never changed and has underwent several acquisitions that only dampered it’s already fragile state. Knowing that, we began anew.</p>            
                        <p>As we began the redesign of Contract Management, we held monthly meetings to review the beta with customers, and receive constructive feedback. From the customer research, we established that the largest pain points in Contract Management were:</p>
                        <p>We examined how we can make managing contracts more collaborative.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="label">Pain Points</div>
                    <p>The team and I spent several weeks with our product managers, engineers, and customers to understand the product and align our vision. The biggest pain points included:</p>
                    <ol class='pain-points'>
                        <li>Manual processes cause errors, increase risk, and is a real waste of human resources</li>    
                        <li>Many times, we’re not entirely sure how the campaign is currently going -- we just heave a sigh of relief after D-day</li>
                        <li>Onboarding takes too long and we often use people to mask the lag time</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>After we felt comfortable with the first set of information we summarized our data that included:</p>
                        <ol class="pain-points">
                            <li>Lack of visibility on the progress</li>    
                            <li>Multiple errors are inherent with so many entry points for information to be entered</li>
                            <li>No streamlined way to roll out, upload, or access data, people, or clients</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>In the end, our objective for the product was to design a solution that was automated, faster, and less prone to manual errors. From there the team and I created moodboards, empathy maps, personas, storyboards, and current/future scenarios to help mold each experience and tailor them for the major focus points.</p>
                </div>
                <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/MRM_Research.jpg">
                <div class="grid-content"> 
                    <div class="label">The Dashboard</div>
                    <p>One of the most obvious changes that was addressed was the current dashboard. The current dashboard was a splash page that included text about the product and was in no way useful to any of the users.  It didn’t include any information about the current activities, tasks, or trading partners that was vital for users to begin their workday.  Users also complained about the lack of organization, hierarchy, and the overwhelming amount of dialogs to find anything.</p>
                    <p>Our goal was to design a dashboard that was intuitive and accounted for on-going activities, assigned tasks, and a directory of trading partners. All while boosting the performance, partner engagement, and cohesiveness throughout the product.</p>
                     <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/MRM_Research3.jpg">
                    <p>During the early stages we knew that there was a big opportunity for change.  We already had customer input about a “Dream Dashboard” and tried to include as many as possible. The team agreed that number of activities, tasks, and current trading partners was of huge importance. Some of the beginning mockups included the status of all the activities, the total number, different types, and some quick links to help navigate.</p>    
                    <p>The feedback was positive overall, but some weaknesses were name of the activity could be very long and wouldn’t fit properly, especially in other languages. Another flaw was it didn’t include tasks or partner information.  This proved to be vital to customers when it was removed so later iterations included them.</p>
                    <div class="embed-container">
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fql6Ui4o3ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style=""></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the end, we went through several iterations with customers and concluded by displaying a set of tasks, their current trading partners, and the number of current activities they’ve created and assigned.  Users can quickly see the number and time remaining for their tasks, the total number of groups, partners in those specific groups, and number of activities, the progress, and time remaining.</p>
                    <p>In all likelihood, we knew everything wouldn’t fit on the page, but we did satisfy many needs and most of the requirements that were placed.</p>
                </div>                
                <div class="grid-content"> 
                    <div class="label">Activity Designer</div>
                    <p>The activity designer was designed to help create any type of campaign or business process for their users. To date, the activity designer was the most challenging problems I’ve come across. In the beta product, users had to create an activity by dragging and dropping certain flowchart pieces on the screen and linking them together. On average, it took our users 21 days to create an activity and this proved to be extremely cumbersome especially when most customers created activities with 100s of steps. </p>
                    <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/MRM-Tablet.jpg">
                    <p>Our goal was the rethink the activity creation process, reduce manual labor, and accelerate the time to create an activity. This included more automated data, less ‘dragging and dropping’, and allowing the user to focus on the information they’re inputting rather than the bulky, tedious, interface.</p>
                    <p>We started by gathering all of the requirements and features. With so many requests from product management and engineering, the team and I needed to focus our design around the personas and customer input. Trouble ensued as we could not focus on set list of focal points because there were too many and customer input did not backup any data by the rest of the product team.  Instead the team and I decided to target the activity designer as a whole instead of specific requirements and features.</p>
                    <p>The team wanted to create a simple process that allowed the user to duplicate sections and then easily update them to fit the rest of the activity. This would reduce the number of steps, clicks, and most importantly, the time. It took several iterations to finally feel comfortable with the experience that we designed, but we felt it was necessary considering the size and scalability of the activity designer. We also wanted to make it as automated as possible, so as users spend more time in the system, the more accurate the populated data would become.</p>
                    <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/MRM-Dashboard.jpg">                      
                    <p>Again the overall feedback was positive, but customers expressed the need for branching logic, templates, and a way to assign activities to their customers. At the end of the release, we listed these three features as the most important.</p>
                    <p>The final design included a more straight-forward and linear process. By empowering the users with automated data, templates, and no dragging and dropping, it became a much easier way to create an activity.</p>

                    <div> 
                        <h3>Challenges —</h3>
                        <p>The main challenge for users was alleviating the fear of missing out or ‘FOMO’ with respect to policy information that may impact them. Staying on top of any issue and being proactive is key to building their strategy. More specifically for this project, users struggled to surface important regulation comments from government agencies.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-DocView-Before.jpg">      
                        <p>After identifying those problems, we were focused on making it easier to read valuable comments and measure them against the others. Our goal was to help our users feel effective when submitting comments.</p>
                        <p>The second challenge was reducing cognitive load and clarifying the information architecture for a simpler experience. Balancing these two requirements required several rounds of researching, iterating, and testing.</p>
                     	<img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-asis.jpg">
						<h3>Solutions —</h3>
                        <p>To resolve our problems, we created two new features: comment themes and a document viewer.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-kickoff.jpg">
                        <p><i>Comment Themes</i>, are distinct groupings of public comments based on the language in the text. Having comments sorted by it’s text and searchable helps find like-minded industry partners to build coalitions and network. This feature ran through several tests, looking at the amount of groups, the use of language, and the ease of locating a specific comment. The team advocated for 12 groups to give users an overview of the comment themes and provide insight into comments across a wide spectrum.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-sketches.jpg">
                        <p>The document viewer displays documents and comment directly in the platform. The viewer helps them search for language that is deemed a risk to the company so they can share that information with their managers. This feature went through rigorous usability tests to determine the most important data to display. Through them we discovered the document type, agencies, comment end date, and <i>Comment Themes</i> are most important when crafting their own comments.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-tobe.jpg">
                        <h3>Feedback —</h3>
                        <p>To test the comment’s ease of use and how comments rank against each other, we performed several usability tests. We asked users to locate a document, open, and read a comment. From there see how that comment ranks against the others and explain how it affects them.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-DocView-After.jpg">
                        <p>From the tests, the task completion rate was 81% and 79% of users would recommend it to their colleagues. Users reacted positively to the new changes because they were able to sift through any comment, read it, and share it with a colleague. Most of the comments they read, they would reuse for their own purpose or or to serve as a basis for a future coalition. All of this feedback led them back to feeling effective and more aware.</p>
                        <img class="image" src="https://www.trentlutmer.me/images/fedregs-CommView-After.jpg">
                        <p>In July 2017, we released the update to everyone and we monitored the data and any feedback from users. We had suggestions ranging from annotating comments, to displaying agency pages. Most of the feedback revolved around building coalitions and bridging the gap into compliance — both we will eventually need to complete the workflow.</p>
                        <h3>Impact —</h3>
                        <p>The next month, we looked into how much money has attributed to the new features and it’s contributed roughly $1.8 million to the company’s ARR.</p>
